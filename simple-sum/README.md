## Synopsis

`simple-sum` is a companion package to a [blog post][] on defining anonymous
sums in Haskell with minimal fanciness. The package is intended for educational
and exploratory use.

If you need an anonymous sum in production, there are many packages to choose
from:

* [`sop-core`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/sop-core)
* [`fastsum`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/fastsum)
* [`summer`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/summer)
* [`world-peace`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/world-peace)
* [`data-diverse`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/data-diverse)
* [`extensible`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/extensible)
* ... and many more ...
